CHANGELOG
=========

v0.0.3 (2022-06-04):
	Additions:

	* Add more context to error messages.

	Fixes:

	* Mirroring and fetching from 'git://' URLs caused timeout errors. Switch
	  to 'https://' URLs.
	* Existing mirrored repositories with new commits were not updated.
	  Previously, only the GitHub repository's `updated_at` field was used to
	  determine if new changes were available. New pushes to a repository,
	  however, don't change the `updated_at` field, but the `pushed_at` field.
	  Now both date-times are used when checking for updates.

v0.0.2 (2021-06-25):
	Fixes:

	* Repository descriptions were not set to the corresponding GitHub
	  description when mirroring repositories on Linux.
	* Empty repositories with no branches or commits now have their mtime set
	  correctly.

	Changes:

	* Set repository mtime to GitHub `pushed_at` time instead of `updated_at`
	  time.
	* Change HEAD to GitHub's default branch and set CGit's default branch to
	  match.

v0.0.1 (2021-06-20):
	First public release.
